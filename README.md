# Shiny-App-for-EDA

It enables us to visualize any interesting patterns in the data, spot outliers, view missingness, understand the correlation between variables. First the user selects the weather station from a dropdown containing 133 stations. Once the station is selected and submitted, the next tab shows the raw dataset and summary of the dataset describing the data type, number of rows and columns and so on. Under the visualisation tab, there are 5 more tabs. Firstly, time series plots where the user can select from and to year to view the DSR, BUI and DC plots. Next tab is the boxplot tab where the outliers can be spotted and the next tab shows the correlation plot for all the variables in the dataset. Users can select any correlation method and any grouping method. Final tab shows the missing value plot.
